    "col_desc": "Extensive parts of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans are covered with sea ice. As the ice is exposed to strong wind and water forces, it is broken up and refrozen into complex patterns. Each day, parts of the pattern change. Every year, an increasing part of it melts away, only to start fresh with the next season. Terrabytes of data imaging the shifting surface are written into archives each day, but very rarely looked at for what they are: Documents of the last years of this mesmerizing spectacle on Earth.",
